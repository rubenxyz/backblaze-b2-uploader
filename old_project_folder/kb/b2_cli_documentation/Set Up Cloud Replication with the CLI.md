## Set Up Cloud Replication with the CLI

___

If you have access to accounts that host both a source bucket and a destination bucket (it can be the same account), you can set up [Cloud Replication](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-cloud-replication) using the command-line interface (CLI). Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage recommends that you use the automatic Replication Setup command. Otherwise, use the manual setup procedure.

## Automatic Setup

Optionally, you can choose the source rule priority and the source rule name using the [Replication Setup](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-replication-setup-command) command.

Note

The Replication Setup command reuses or provisions a source key with no prefix and full reading capabilities and a destination key with no prefix and full writing capabilities.

## Manual Setup

Follow these steps to manually set up Cloud Replication.Â
