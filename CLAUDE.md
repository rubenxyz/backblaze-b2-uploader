## Agent Behaviour Rules

### General Behavior

- MUST: Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- MUST: Verify all changes work before confirming completion
- SHOULD: Run tests before committing code
- SHOULD: Provide clear explanations for complex changes
- SHOULD NOT: Make assumptions about file locations or project structure

### Error Handling

- MUST: Report errors with full context to the user
- MUST: Continue processing other items when individual items fail
- SHOULD: Suggest solutions when errors occur
- SHOULD: Validate inputs before processing
- SHOULD NOT: Silently ignore errors or warnings

## USER-FILES Protection Rules

### ABSOLUTE FORBIDDEN - USER-FILES/04.INPUT/
- MUST NEVER: Create ANY files in USER-FILES/04.INPUT/ for ANY reason
- MUST NEVER: Delete ANY files from USER-FILES/04.INPUT/ 
- MUST NEVER: Modify ANY files in USER-FILES/04.INPUT/
- MUST NEVER: Move or rename ANY files in USER-FILES/04.INPUT/
- MUST NEVER: Write test files, example files, or ANY files to USER-FILES/04.INPUT/
- CAN ONLY: Read files from USER-FILES/04.INPUT/ - nothing else

### General USER-FILES Rules
- MUST: Never create files in USER-FILES/ without explicit permission
- MUST: Never delete files in USER-FILES/ without explicit permission  
- MUST: Never modify existing files in USER-FILES/ without explicit permission
- MUST: Never move or rename files in USER-FILES/ without explicit permission
- MUST: Never auto-archive or auto-organize files in USER-FILES/
- MUST: Leave input files exactly where they are after processing
- MUST: Ask "May I create/modify/delete/move [specific file] in USER-FILES?" before any operation
- SHOULD: Treat USER-FILES/ as external user data that you DO NOT manage
- SHOULD: Only read from USER-FILES/04.INPUT/ and write to USER-FILES/05.OUTPUT/
- SHOULD NOT: Use USER-FILES/07.TEMP/ when user says "save to temp" - use project root instead
- SHOULD NOT: Implement any "cleanup" or "archiving" features for USER-FILES

## Project Structure Rules

- MUST: Read inputs only from USER-FILES/04.INPUT/
- MUST: Write outputs only to USER-FILES/05.OUTPUT/ with timestamps
- MUST: Use YYMMDD_HHMMSS format for output directories
- SHOULD: Preserve input directory structure in outputs
- SHOULD: Store configurations in appropriate USER-FILES subdirectories

## Python Code Standards

- MUST: Use type hints for all function signatures
- MUST: Use pathlib.Path for file operations (not os.path)
- SHOULD: Keep functions under 50 lines
- SHOULD: Format with black and lint with ruff
- SHOULD: Add docstrings for all public functions

## Testing Standards

- MUST: Write tests for critical functionality
- SHOULD: Test happy paths and edge cases
- SHOULD: Mock external dependencies
- SHOULD: Keep tests fast and focused
- SHOULD NOT: Test implementation details

## API Integration

- MUST: Implement rate limiting for external APIs
- MUST: Set timeouts on all requests
- SHOULD: Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- SHOULD: Log API interactions for debugging
- SHOULD NOT: Hardcode API keys or secrets

## Configuration Management

- MUST: Use environment variables for sensitive data
- MUST: Validate configuration at startup
- SHOULD: Provide sensible defaults
- SHOULD: Separate tool config from processing profiles
- SHOULD: Support different environments (dev/test/prod)

## Dependency Management

- MUST: Pin exact versions in requirements.txt
- MUST: Use virtual environments
- SHOULD: Separate dev and production dependencies
- SHOULD: Document required environment variables
- SHOULD: Keep dependencies minimal

## Error Recovery

- MUST: Log errors with full context
- MUST: Provide user-friendly error messages
- SHOULD: Support recovery from partial failures
- SHOULD: Create detailed failure reports
- SHOULD NOT: Stop entire process for single item failures

## File Processing

- MUST: Never modify original input files
- MUST: Never move input files after processing
- MUST: Create timestamped output directories
- MUST: Input files stay in USER-FILES/04.INPUT/ permanently
- SHOULD: Show progress for long operations
- SHOULD: Support dry-run mode
- SHOULD: Process files in configurable batches
- SHOULD NOT: Auto-archive processed files to USER-FILES/06.DONE/
